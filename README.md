# Farmer Assistant System

Hosted At: http://54.235.4.9/

Implemented Machine Learning model to detect the different disease on plants using the images.

Used Plant Dataset from kaggle. Link Below

Dataset Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease

This model is used while predicting the disease on our front-end which has been developed using flask framework.

This project also consists of an API based bot which answers simple farmer queries. Watson API has been used.

I have also provided an static page which provides various information about crops such as different diseases caused by them, their ways of treatment and many more things.
